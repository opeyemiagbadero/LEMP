##WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK) IN AWS ##

I updated the server package to get Nginx installed using the commands sudo apt update and sudo apt install nginx

To verify that nginx was successfully installed and running as a service in Ubuntu, I ran the sudo systemctl status nginx command

I confirmed that Nginx server can respond to requests from the Internet by inputting the public ip address of the server on a web browser

I installed the mysql server using the same apt command i.e sudo apt install mysql-server and logged into mysql console

I set up a  password for the root user, using mysql_native_password as default authentication method, ran a script that will remove some 
insecure default settings and lock down access to my database system and confirmed that I could log in to the MySQL console by typing $ sudo mysql -p

In the process of installing  PHP, I installed php-fpm, which and tells Nginx to pass PHP requests to the software for processing 
followed by  php-mysql, a PHP module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases.

In configuring Nginx to use PHP Processor, 
I created the root web directory for the your_domain,assigned ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable, referencing my current system user, 
opened a new configuration file in Nginx’s sites-available directory and pasted in a configuration in the file.
I Activated my configuration by linking to the config file from Nginx’s sites-enabled directory, tested the config files for errors and reloaded nginx to
apply changes. I Created an index.html file in that location so that we can test that my new server block works as expected.

I opened my website URL using the the ip address http://44.204.67.181:80 to confirm that nginx was working as expected.

In testing php with nginx, i opened a new file called info.php in the /var/www/projectLEMP/ directory and copied a php code that will return information
about the server. I accessed the page in my web browser by visiting http://44.204.67.181/info.php set up in my Nginx configuration file.

I connected to mysql server  console using my root account and created a database named example_database and a user named example_user. I 
confirmed that the new user has the proper permissions by logging in to the MySQL console again, using the command mysql -u example_user -p


![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79456052/174486261-d4a0d2cb-7ac6-4d63-885d-707d63baa054.png)

I confirmed access to the example_ database after  logging in to the MySQL console, created a test table named todo_list. followed by inserting a few rows of content in the test table. 

I then created a new PHP file in my  custom web root directory i.e /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php, copied the given content and saved the file.

I opened the domain name or public IP address configured for my  website http://44.204.67.181 followed by /todo_list.php i.e http://44.204.67.181//todo_list.php
